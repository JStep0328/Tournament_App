# Tournament_App

Six Team Double Elimination Tournament with first round byes using shinyapps.io

Used the following repo as a starting point for creating a bracket
https://github.com/zachmayer/kaggleNCAA

Also had some help from a co-worker to understand what the Zach was doing, especially with his printableBracket.R code.

My goal is to eventually automate this code so you can select different number of teams, and whether or not there are first round byes.
